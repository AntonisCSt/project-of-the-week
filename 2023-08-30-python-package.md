## DIY Python package

* **Goal**: Get started learning some basic software engineering concepts. By the end of the week, you will have successfully developed a Python package while incorporating essential best practices. These practices include executing unit tests, running a linter, and ensuring proper documentation to enhance the overall functionality and maintainability of your package.
* **Dates**: from 30th August to 4th September.
* **Where:** [`#project-of-the-week`](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C02BP4FQH36) in DataTalks.Club (get in slack here: [https://datatalks.club/slack.html](https://datatalks.club/slack.html))

For more information about the "Project of the Week" initiative

## Plan

This is a proposed plan only, you don’t have to follow it day-by-day.

### Day 1 (30 August, Wednesday)
* Come up with a project idea by selecting any existing code that already includes functions (see Suggestions below).
* Read the tutorial [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#packaging-python-projects) to become familiar with the fundamental components of a Python package.
* Create a GitHub repository for your Python package.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

Suggestions

* Find a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) kernel that features functions for preprocessing data.
* Use existing code from a previous project.
* Find a blog post that showcases some functions. For example, check the functions showcased in the following articles:
    * 🗒️ [How to Test Machine Learning Code and Systems](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/testing-ml/)
    * 🗒️ [Writing Robust Tests for Data & Machine Learning Pipelines](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/testing-pipelines/)
* 💻 Check [this sample project](https://github.com/lilianabs/text_preprocessing) to get an idea of a possible final outcome.

### Day 2 (31 August, Thursday)
* Create a virtual environment for developing your Python package
* Create the initial project structure as suggested in the tutorial [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#packaging-python-projects).
* (Optional) Create a Docker image for running your package
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

Suggested materials

* 🗒️ [How to Set Up a Virtual Environment in Python – And Why It's Useful](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)
* 🗒️ [Alternatively, use Docker as a Dev Environment instead](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/setting-up-python-project-for-automation-and-collaboration/#alternatively-use-docker-as-a-dev-environment-instead)

### Day 3 (1 September, Friday)

* Add functions to your package.
    * Feel free to utilize functions you've previously developed or those sourced from platforms like Kaggle or GitHub (please attribute appropriately if using code from others).
    * If you require an example of basic functions, you may refer to [Python 101 – How to Create a Python Package](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2021/09/23/python-101-how-to-create-a-python-package/) for guidance.
* (Optional) Add tests for the functions you’ve included.
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

### Day 4 (2 September, Saturday)

* Add [docstrings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) to all of the functions.
* Use a formatter such as [black](https://github.com/psf/black) to format your code.
* Use a [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) to validate that your code complies with [PEP-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.
